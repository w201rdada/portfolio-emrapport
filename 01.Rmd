## Data collection methods pose a challenge

In the past few years, police brutality has become part of the national conversation due to a large number of high profile incidents in which police officers killed unarmed, usually African-American citizens. These high profile cases represent only a few of tens of thousands of misconduct complaints brought to police departments every year. Between March 2011 and September 2015, 28,567 misconduct complaints were brought before the Chicago Police Department, according to the [Citizens Police Data Project](https://cpdb.co/findings/). Journalists, activists, and other concerned community members want to find patterns in this data in order to work towards a safer, more just relationship between police departments and the citizens they serve. I would like to work as a data scientist alongside these community stakeholders by using natural language processing to help detect text patterns.

## Using complaint text to find patterns

A significant challenge to finding these patterns is the way in which police misconduct complaints are categorized. Different bureaus handle different types of complaints, and whichever individual in that bureau intakes a complaint has the discretion to choose what single category a complaint is filed under, even though the narrative accounts of many complaints suggest that multiple complaint categories could apply to a single encounter. As a result, the official complaint categories have the potential to obfuscate patterns in the data by reducing multi-faceted reports to single category labels.

As a data scientist working on this issue alongside journalists, activists, and other community members, I would want to return to the raw text in the complaints in order to identify more accurate complaint categories. We could do this using a number of text analysis methods. I propose the following steps:
* Parse text complaints into individual words or phrases. Care should be taken to correct misspellings and group words by their roots; given that the text complaints will have been written by different authors in varying styles, the tokenization methods should allow for fuzzy matching between words (ex: "grab," "grabbed," and "grabbing" would all map to the same token ID). The tokenization method should also eliminate very common words.   
* Then, use a method like bag-of-words or n-grams to find a representation for each text that accounts for the frequency of tokens in the text.
* Next, use a clustering algorithm to generate new categories for the complaints based on the text. We should experiment with different clustering algorithms and different numbers of clusters, then examine the reports in each cluster to determine if they represent cohesive and specific categories.
* Tag each complaint with other relevant features:
  + the time: year, month, date, day of the week, time of day
  + location: neighborhood, cross streets, public vs private space
  + officer data: name, rank, number of misconduct cases against him/her
This additional data could be used alongside the text clustering categories in order to find new patterns that can allow the journalists and activists working on this issue to tell richer stories about police misconduct.

## Choosing how to share data

Data scientists who conduct this work should be deliberate about how they present their findings, given the politically charged nature of the national conversation about police misconduct and the complicated politics around the police unions and their relationships with the city government in Chicago. Journalists and activists should consider whether to use this data to inform stories and reports that they will publish and bring to the city, or whether to publish interactive visualizations of the clusters in order to let the public explore the data on their own. Those involved should take cues from groups like the Citizens Police Data Project and other public data projects on how to make the data as accessible as possible, which includes educating the public on how to use and understand data sets and visualizations that are made public.
