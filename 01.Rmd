## Connecting the dots between website behavior and phone calls.

To determine our biggest opportunities for improving the search engine, we should start by gathering data that will help us understand where users are struggling in the search experience. We can use data that we already have in our interaction database that collects data about user's behavior on our website (low click-through terms, low success terms, patterns in what people are searching.) A data source we hae yet to explore is audio data from customers' calls into our contact centers. As e-commerce has become more prevalent, our phone contact centers have fielded fewer calls for standard orders and more calls for scenarios in which the customer can't find what he or she is looking for. These calls are a major untapped resource for us, as they indicate poor web experiences and give us additional information we can't get from web clicks alone. What we need to do: connect calls to user accounts so that we can have labeled data on what people were looking for and what they actually bought. Combine that call data with web data to analyze.
