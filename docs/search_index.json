["identifying-policing-patterns-from-text.html", "1 The Context Behind The Categories in Police Misconduct Complaints 1.1 Looking Beyond High Profile Misconduct Cases 1.2 Creating Related Clusters Based on Complaint Text 1.3 Choosing how to share data", " 1 The Context Behind The Categories in Police Misconduct Complaints Keywords police abuse, police shootings, police brutality, text analysis, clustering, natural language processing 1.1 Looking Beyond High Profile Misconduct Cases In the past few years, police brutality has become part of the national conversation in the United States. There have been many high profile incidents in which police officers killed unarmed, usually African-American citizens. These widely-reported cases represent only a few of tens of thousands of misconduct complaints brought to police departments every year. Between March 2011 and September 2015, 28,567 misconduct complaints were brought before the Chicago Police Department (CPD), according to the Citizens Police Data Project (Institute 2018). Journalists, activists, and other concerned community members want to find patterns in this data in order to work towards a safer, more just relationship between police departments and the citizens they serve. I will work as a data scientist alongside these community stakeholders by using natural language processing to help detect patterns in complaint text. 1.2 Creating Related Clusters Based on Complaint Text A significant challenge to finding these patterns is the way in which police misconduct complaints are categorized. After a citizen files a complaint to the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, the complaint gets routed either to COPA itself or to the CPD’s Bureau of Internal Affairs (COPA 2018). In either institution, whichever individual intakes a complaint has the discretion to choose what single category a complaint is filed under, even though the narrative accounts of many complaints suggest that multiple complaint categories could apply to a single encounter. As a result, the official complaint categories have the potential to obfuscate patterns in the data by reducing multi-faceted reports to single-category labels. As a data scientist working on this issue alongside journalists, activists, and other community members, I want to return to the raw text in the complaints in order to identify more nuanced complaint categories. We could do this using a number of text analysis methods. I propose the following steps: Parse text complaints into individual words or phrases. Care should be taken to correct misspellings and group words by their roots; given that the text complaints will have been written by different authors in varying styles, the tokenization methods should use stemming and lemmatization to identify related words (ex: “grab,” “grabbed,” and “grabbing” would all map to the same token ID). The tokenization method should also eliminate very common words. Then, use a method like bag-of-words or n-grams to find a representation for each complaint that accounts for the frequency of tokens in the text. Next, use a clustering algorithm to generate new categories for the complaints based on the text. We should experiment with different clustering algorithms and different numbers of clusters, then examine the reports in each cluster to determine if they represent cohesive and specific categories. Tag each complaint with other relevant features: the time: year, month, date, day of the week, time of day location: neighborhood, cross streets, public vs private space officer data: name, rank, number of misconduct cases against him/her These additional data tags can be used alongside the text clustering categories in order to find new patterns. For instance, is a certain group of officers always involved in a particular cluster of complaints? Or is there a particular type of complaint that always occurs in a certain neighborhood at the same time of day? For journalists, these patterns can help them tell richer stories about police misconduct. For activists, these patterns can help them identify specific problem areas around which to create awareness campaigns and policy goals. 1.3 Choosing how to share data As a data scientist working on this issue, I aim to help my collaborators be deliberate about how they present findings, given the politically charged nature of the national conversation about police misconduct and the complicated politics around police unions and the city government in Chicago. I intend to ensure that my collaborators understand the language processing methods well enough to make responsible use of the findings. My journalist and activist collaborators should consider whether to publish interactive visualizations of the clusters in order to let the public explore the data on their own, or whether to share select findings from the data through their writing and organizing. If we share the data itself more broadly, we should take cues from groups like the Citizens Police Data Project on how to make the data as accessible as possible, which includes educating the public on how to use and understand the data.

["gamify-trash.html", "2 Trace Your Waste 2.1 I want to waste less - kind of 2.2 Enter the TrashDash app 2.3 Before you trash this idea…", " 2 Trace Your Waste Keywords environment, climate change, app 2.1 I want to waste less - kind of According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in 2014, Americans generated 258 million tons of trash (US EPA 2015). Landfills are a major source of pollution, releasing toxins into air and water that are associated with climate change and other negative environmental impacts. Many Americans are concerned with the environment and want to generate less waste, but translating that sentiment into action can be hard. It is easy to want to be more environmentally conscious after reading a compelling article about pollution or watching a dramatic documentary about climate change; it is harder to actually make eco-friendly choices while grocery shopping, preparing a family meal, or planning your commute. Our data science team at TrashDash wants to reduce the environmental impact caused by landfills by helping our potential users reduce the waste they generate. We believe that by measuring users’ waste production and presenting them with visualizations and other analysis that makes sense of their actions, users will better understand their relationship to aggregate waste production data and, consequently, will feel motivated to waste less. 2.2 Enter the TrashDash app TrashDash is a habit-building Internet of Things product that makes reducing the waste you generate easier and more fun than ever before. TrashDash’s central question is: how can we quantify the amount of trash that individuals are generating, and how can we present information about that trash to them in order to help them produce less? The TrashDash system will keep track of all of the trash you generate and motivate you to create less waste over time by tracking your progress towards goals, providing personalized tips based on your recorded waste, and allowing you to compete against your friends. The TrashDash data science team will create a data pipeline that uses a variety of data collection and machine learning techniques to provide users with a seamless TrashDash experience. New TrashDashers will have two ways to begin implementing the system: Purchase a state-of-the-art TrashDash garbage can, which includes all of the features needed to collect weight, volume, and photo data of trash contents. Sign up to receive the TrashDash starter kit, which includes a compact scale that can be placed at the bottom of a standard kitchen trash bag. Users who opt for this option will need to contribute by taking mobile photos of their trash at periodic intervals. For users with a wearable watch device, a sensor on the scale can cause an alert on the watch device that alerts the user to take the photo when she approaches the trash can. Both systems will make a user’s waste generation measurable by gathering extensive data about users’ trash, which will be analyzed and visualized on TrashDash’s app. TrashDash will use convolutional neural networks to analyze the photo data that comes in from the TrashDash cans or from user-uploaded images. The CNNs will help identify what types of items make up the trash, and that data will be corroborated with weight data from the TrashDash cans or scales to help generate an overall profile of users’ trash. On the app, users will be able to see data about their waste generation and see how their quantities and trash types stack up against TrashDash’s average users and their friends on the app. The app will also make habit changes manageable and motivational for users. The app will make changes manageable for users by providing personalized trash-reducing tips based on the waste categories that are most prevalent in a user’s trash. For instance, if a user’s waste profile indicates a high percentage of disposable beverage containers, the app will provide links to purchase travel mugs. The app will motivate users to form new habits by encouraging them to challenge each other to waste-curbing challenges. It will also help users understand the impact they are having as individuals and as part of the TrashDash community by periodically showing statistics about the amount of waste they have kept out of landfills, and providing comparisons that make those statistics comprehensible. Ex: “This month, your TrashDash friend circle prevented 1000 pounds of trash from entering landfills. That’s the equivalent of a horse!” Millions of TrashDash users, in aggregate, can make a substantial impact on the amount of trash that the United States produces, but just imagine how much larger that impact might be if companies got involved. TrashDash could amplify its impact - and provide a corporate caring opportunity for companies of all sizes - by creating ways for companies to participate by joining a corporate TrashDash league, providing TrashDash cans in work cafeterias so that employees can participate at work, or “matching” employees’ TrashDash waste savings with contributions to conservation organizations. In exchange for participating in these programs, companies can receive advertising on the TrashDash app. 2.3 Before you trash this idea… …we know you’re probably concerned about data privacy, especially regarding photos of user trash. You might not want your friends to know what’s in there, let alone a bunch of data scientists. To maintain your privacy, we aim to identify only trash categories, not individual trash items; additionally, only you see your trash categories, not your friends. Your trash categories will be used towards determining the average trash distribution of all TrashDash users, so your data will be aggregated with that of millions of other users. We also assure you that your individual account data will be linked to an ID number for all data science work, and a limited number of senior individuals will have access to the tables that link user names to ID numbers. We hope that users’ eagerness to minimize their environmental footprint will win out against potential privacy concerns. As more and more types of user devices become connected, TrashDash could start measuring other types of user environmental impact. A smart refrigerator could monitor when produce is put into it and give friendly reminders when food is nearing its expiration date, and a connected car could monitor gas usage. TrashDash is eager to combine data from Internet of Things products with compelling data presentations to motivate users to take control of their environmental impact. Bibliography "],
